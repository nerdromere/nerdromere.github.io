# [_Tutoring_](./tutoring)
I will be private tutoring this summer for any math levels ranging from pre-algebra
to calculus and Linear algebra, so feel free to click <a href="./tutoring">here </a>
for more information. I also tutor Java, C, C++, and can provide letters of
recommendations if so desired.

# [Python](./python)
I will be learning Python this summer as many it's becoming a popular language
at many tech companies. It will start from the basics (know a language before
hand though) and goes into networking and ends with a data science project.

# [Interview Questions](./interview-questions)
Join me in reviewing tricky questions which attack the core of your CS knowledge.
This may be more of a wakeup to what you need to know to be ready for the top
tech companies. I will use LeetCode and other various sites to compile a list of
questions to go over. This will be done in both Java and C/C++.

# Using Git
Just a quick reminder that git will be used in all of the projects, and the principles
described in O'Reilly book "Git for Teams". Again, join me if you want to work on
any of these projects.

# [IMDb Web Crawler w/ JDBC](./imdb-jdbc)
Uses the JSoup API to parse out Movie details from the IMDb website and  store it
in a database located locally, or on personal server (latter probably due to the
high amount of data). Click [here](./imdb-jdbc) for more information.

# [Advanced Java Concepts](./java-concepts)
A five-six hour session going over concepts that are not taught in class or arg
briefly introduced. Click header for more info.

# [Linux](./linux)
Since Linux is open-source, and will stay open source, it is the norm to know
it. I urge all CS students to get familiar with it, and maybe even join me in
exploring it. I'll be setting up a server at home instead of a virtual machine
on my personal computer, and hosting another personal website with apache.

# [Apache](./apache)
Going off of the previous section, setting up all sort of services on Linux will
be ideal, and Apache is one of them. If you want to learn about it with me,
then definitely send me an email at i.eremenko1303@edmail.edcc.edu.

#[Apps/Website](./apps-websites)
I have a few app/website ideas in mind that I may get to this summer, but they
are quite complex and may take a while to make; after creating the IoT in
Android Apps, I've had enough :)
