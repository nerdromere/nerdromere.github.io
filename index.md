# [Tutoring](./tutoring)
I will be private tutoring this summer for any math levels ranging from pre-algebra
to calculus and Linear algebra, so feel free to click <a href="./tutoring">here </a>
for more information. I also tutor Java, C, C++, and can provide letters of
recommendations if so desired.

# [Interview Questions](./interview-questions)
Join me in reviewing tricky questions which attack the core of your CS knowledge.
This may be more of a wakeup to what you need to know to be ready for the top
tech companies. I will use LeetCode and other various sites to compile a list of
questions to go over. This will be done in both Java and C/C++.
