# [--Tutoring--](./tutoring)
I will be private tutoring this summer for any math levels ranging from pre-algebra
to calculus and Linear algebra, so feel free to click <a href="./tutoring">here </a>
for more information. I also tutor Java, C, C++, and can provide letters of
recommendations if so desired.

# [Interview Questions](./interview-questions)
Join me in reviewing tricky questions which attack the core of your CS knowledge.
This may be more of a wakeup to what you need to know to be ready for the top
tech companies. I will use LeetCode and other various sites to compile a list of
questions to go over. This will be done in both Java and C/C++.

# Using Git
Just a quick reminder that git will be used in all of the projects, and the principles
described in O'Reilly book "Git for Teams". Again, join me if you want to work on
any of these projects.
# [IMDb Web Crawler w/ JDBC](./imdb-jdbc)
Uses the JSoup API to parse out Movie details from the IMDb website and  store it
in a database located locally, or on personal server (latter probably due to the
high amount of data). Click [here](./imdb-jdbc) for more information.
