# Join Me!
I haven't yet begun this endeavor, but contact me quickly so we can dedicate
some time to this. I would much rather learn this as a group than by myself. I
am a tutor at heart, and enjoy helping people with math/programming. I will be
starting on the 15th of July.

## Prerequisites
* 1+ years of academic coding
* Keen on learning a new language.
* Can adapt to the fast pace

## Plan
* Use stepbystep to practice the code, and use a youtube video to learn it.
I'll also look for a pdf book online. I am still planning it, so give me any
recommendations.

* Watch this video before meeting up:

Very good video for programmers!

## Progress
Will update when started and people are on board.
