## Description
It will be a session sometime during the summer, email me if you want to be a
part of it. I'll design it so it covers most of Java and then stem into reading
from different mediums, lambda expressions, enums, multithreading and more.

## Prerequisites
At least some knowledge on Java and maybe classes.
