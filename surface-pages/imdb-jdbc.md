## Email me if interested!
I will be starting this project sometime soon on GitHub, so watch out
for that. I may slow down for this project to explain it to anyone who wants to
learn it; make sure to look at the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites
* MySQL Server
* JDBC

### Ideally,
* Some SQL experience
* 1+ years of Java

# Description
Each page on IMDb has 12 recommended or similar films. If the film is not
already in the list, then add it, visit its link, and look at each of _its_
movies and so on. The idea is that it will span all the movies on the database,
so we'll go slow for the bot, I don't want to be kicked/banned. We will use the
top 100, 500, 1000 list, but I'm sure we can get far if we start from one film.

### Skills it will touch
* Sorting
* Searching
* Classes
* Reducing coupling
* Building custom data structure
* Testing
