# Another Important Skill

Go on indeed.com and try and find a job that doesn't recommend you to know
Linux/Unix systems. If you are already familiar and you can give me a few
pointers that would be good. If not, then learn with me.

I want to write some scripts that would act as services for me and my future
projects.

This would ideally tie in with the JDBC IMDb project, and create a database
and store everything on there.
