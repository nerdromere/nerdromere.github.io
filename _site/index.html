      <h1 id="tutoring"><a href="./tutoring"><em>Tutoring</em></a></h1>
<p>I will be private tutoring this summer for any math levels ranging from pre-algebra
to calculus and Linear algebra, so feel free to click <a href="./tutoring">here </a>
for more information. I also tutor Java, C, C++, and can provide letters of
recommendations if so desired.</p>

<h1 id="websites">Websites</h1>
<p>A quick shoutout, I’ll be making websites for people, so reach out to me
if you want a personal website, (something basic like this, or something a bit
more complex) just email me at nerdromere@gmail.com.</p>

<h1 id="python"><a href="./python"><em>Python</em></a></h1>
<p>I will be learning Python this summer as many it’s becoming a popular language
at many tech companies. It will start from the basics (know a language before
hand though) and goes into networking and ends with a data science project.</p>

<h1 id="interview-questions"><a href="./interview-questions"><em>Interview Questions</em></a></h1>
<p>Join me in reviewing tricky questions which attack the core of your CS knowledge.
This may be more of a wakeup to what you need to know to be ready for the top
tech companies. I will use LeetCode and other various sites to compile a list of
questions to go over. This will be done in both Java and C/C++.</p>

<h1 id="using-git">Using Git</h1>
<p>Just a quick reminder that git will be used in all of the projects, and the principles
described in O’Reilly book “Git for Teams”. Again, join me if you want to work on
any of these projects.</p>

<h1 id="imdb-web-crawler-w-jdbc"><a href="./imdb-jdbc"><em>IMDb Web Crawler w/ JDBC</em></a></h1>
<p>Uses the JSoup API to parse out Movie details from the IMDb website and  store it
in a database located locally, or on personal server (latter probably due to the
high amount of data). Click <a href="./imdb-jdbc">here</a> for more information.</p>

<h1 id="advanced-java-concepts"><a href="./java-concepts"><em>Advanced Java Concepts</em></a></h1>
<p>A five-six hour session going over concepts that are not taught in class or just
briefly introduced. Click header for more info.</p>

<h1 id="sql">SQL</h1>
<p>This should be covered in the JDBC IMDb project, but extra practice on
<a href="stepbystep.com">stepbystep.com</a> will be done. Not much more to it. I am keen
on learning this with someone.</p>

<h1 id="regex"><a href="./regex"><em>Regex</em></a></h1>
<p>You need to know REGEX as a CS student! I think this will be in the form of
making a one v one game where there is a set of information you need to gather
with a regex expression. I’ll make the game stub on GitHub.</p>

<h1 id="linux"><a href="./linux"><em>Linux</em></a></h1>
<p>Since Linux is open-source, and will stay open source, it is the norm to know
it. I urge all CS students to get familiar with it, and maybe even join me in
exploring it. I’ll be setting up a server at home instead of a virtual machine
on my personal computer, and hosting another personal website with apache.</p>

<h1 id="apache"><a href="./apache"><em>Apache</em></a></h1>
<p>Going off of the previous section, setting up all sort of services on Linux will
be ideal, and Apache is one of them. If you want to learn about it with me,
then definitely send me an email at i.eremenko1303@edmail.edcc.edu.</p>

<p>#<a href="./apps-websites"><em>Apps//Website</em></a>
I have a few app/website ideas in mind that I may get to this summer, but they
are quite time-consuming and may take a while to make; after creating IoT door
sensor in Android Apps, I’ve had enough, I want more programming.</p>
